				<h3>Site Redesign</h3>
				<small><i>07/11/2019</i></small>
				<p>I decided to go back to something simpler after messing around with Wordpress for a while. My main goal with using Wordpress was to learn some of its basics, which I did. I don't need all the crazy plugins that you can add, SEO tools, themes, and back-end tools. Those things are really cool, but I'd rather just work directly with the code. The ability to quickly and easily make blog posts was nice, but I want to work more on the back-end and have some fun tinkering with things.</p>

				<p>I'm now using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 4</a> and will add some templating with <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a> once I get some more time. There's also some other frameworks I'm interested in using, so the functionality of the site might be down for periods of time while I figure things out. The <a href="https://ghough.com/photos.html">Photos</a> section is up with a selection of picutres from my year in Germany as well as some photos I took for a photography class a long time ago. The photo albums are stored on Google Photos and are generated with <a href="https://www.publicalbum.org/blog/embedding-google-photos-albums">this</a> tool and it works really well. Much easier than storing the files on a local disk and it looks nice too.</p>

				<p>I'll be adding more content here over time which will hopefully include more coding and work related topics.</p>
