					<p>This is a fun game! I've spent probably 4 hours playing it and I'm about 85% of the way through. It is a short game but it's packed with fast gameplay and an interesting story. Think Hotline Miami but 2D action platformer. Fantastic soundtrack mixed with a great sci-fi cyberpunk aesthetic. I love that it's on the shorter side and that I don't need to invest 50 hours into a mediocre story to feel like I completed it.</p>

					<p>The first Souls-esque game that I actually enjoy. I played a little of Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, and Bloodborne but I could never really get into them. I think part of the reason those other games didn't sit with me well was the poor frame rates would lead to choppy gameplay and frustrating deaths that felt like weren't my fault. Playing Sekiro on the PC with a solid 60 FPS makes combat very fluid and I really feel like I'm in control.</p>
						
					<p>It's also said that this started out as a remake of the Tenchu series, which I loved. Sekiro playes heavily twords stealth and having a high degree of mobility along with having perfect timing for blocking and dodging. Although it is difficult, it plays wonderfully.</p>
