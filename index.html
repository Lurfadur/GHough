				<p>I watched this last night on Netflix and it's a solid sci-fi film. Lots of uneasy tension between characters as the story progresses and has a concrete ending that I feel is missing in some movies these days. Not much to say about it because the less you know going in the better. I highly recommend <i>I Am Mother</i> if you've watched a lot of the other stuff already out there and are looking for something different.</p>

				<h5>Lion King (2019)</h5>

				<p>The 1994 version of <i>The Lion King</i> holds a special place in the hearts of many. A fantastic (though not totally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimba_the_White_Lion#The_Lion_King_controversy">original or unique</a>) story that elevated Disney to god tier status in the 90's. Simba, Timon and Pumbaa, Scar, and every other character had several lines of merchandise. Even if you've never seen the movie, you've seen the characters. Many still consider this one of the last great Disney animated movies ever made because of the amazing soundtrack, story, andimation, and style.</p>
				<p>In the past few years, Disney has decided to remake some of it's more famous animated hits. This isn't anything entirely new to Disney, what with the live action version of <i>101 Dalmatians</i> in 2000. But, starting in 2014 there seems to be a spike in the amount of these live action remakes. Of the last nine films released, three have been somewhat well received. The 2019 remake of <i>The Lion King</i> is sitting firmly in the "middle of the road" at a 52% from critics and 88% from audiences on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_lion_king_2019">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. After a lot of internal debating, I give it a solid score and would recommend people check it out. I don't think it's better than the original animated feature but it does add <em>something</em> to the experience.</p>
				<p>Did watching it ruin my childhood? No, and neither did the 100's of other direct-to-video sequels we got growing up. Does it do anything new? <em>Kinda</em>. Is it worth seeing? Yes.</p>
